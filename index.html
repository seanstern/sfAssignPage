<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Part 0: Basic Visualization and Introductory Fact Finding</h3>
In this part of the lab, you will be responsible for writing code that will enable you to:
<ul>
<li>visualize the locations of the stops recorded by the NYPD in the Stop, Question, and Frisk Report Database by
    <ul>
    <li>determining the range of x and y coordinates in the data set</li>
    <li>drawing each point at the appropriate x and y coordinate</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>answer questions about differing treatment of suspects in the database based on their identified race including
    <ul>
    <li>How do the total number of stops involving a suspect of a particular race compare to the overall population?</li>
    <li>On average, how long are stop suspects of a particular race stopped for?</li>
    <li>On average, how long are stop suspects of a particular race charged with a crime?</li>
    <li>On average, how often are stop suspects of a particular race subject to use of physical force by police officers?</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 1: Animated Visualization and Independent Fact Finding</h3>
In this part of the lab, you will be responsible for writing code that will enable you to:
<ul>
<li>animate your visualization to show the stops involving all suspects of a given race (e.g. show all stops involving Asian/Pacific Islander suspects in PINK, then show all stops involving Black suspects in BLUE, then show all stops involving Hispanic suspects in RED, etc.)</li>
<li>brainstorm and write code to answer TWO of your OWN questions about your data set that
    <ul>
    <li>would help determine the extent to which stop and frisk is racially discriminatory</li>
    <li>utilize at least 4 different columns of data NOT YET examined in part 0</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 2: Advanced Animation</h3>
In the summer of 2013, the NYPD's implementation of stop and frisk was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/08/12/judge-says-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-law-unconstitutional/">ruled unconstitutional</a> because it was "a form of racial profiling" with a disproportionate focus on Black and Hispanic New Yorkers. As a result, the NYPD was ordered to revise its stop and frisk policy.<br/><br/>

In this lab, you will be responsible for writing code that will help you determine if these revisions to the stop and frisk policy have changed how officers actually conduct stop and frisk. To do so, create an animation that shows all the change in stop and frisks across time in New York.
